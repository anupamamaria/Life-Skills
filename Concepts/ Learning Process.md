Question 2

In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea to me was that how pomodoro technique can help us improve our focus. Rather than setting difficult targets to learn or focus on something for long hours, we can set the target to focus for 25 minutes and then be relaxed for few minutes. Over time, this can improve our focus and help us in our learning journey.

Question 3

What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active mode is the focused, concentrated way of thinking which we use when we are directly working on a problem or studying.
Diffused Mode is a relaxed, unconscious thinking state.
We start in active mode to learn anything new and practise. Then we switch to diffused mode by relaxing. This lets our brain subconsciously work on the concept. Switching between these two modes can help us improve our learning process.
