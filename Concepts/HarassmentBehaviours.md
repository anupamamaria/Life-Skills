## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?


Sexual harassment includes any inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature that makes someone feel uncomfortable or humiliated. It can happen in workplaces, public spaces or online. Some common behaviors that cause sexual harassment include:

### Verbal Harassment
- Making sexual comments or jokes.

- Asking personal or intrusive questions about someoneâ€™s sex life or appearance.

- Repeatedly asking for dates despite being rejected.


### Visual Harassment
- Staring or making inappropriate gestures.

- Sending sexually suggestive emails, messages, or images.

- Displaying pornographic or sexually explicit content in shared spaces.

### Physical Harassment
- Unwanted touching, hugging etc.

- Kissing or attempting to initiate physical contact without consent.


### Hostile Work Environment
- Offering job benefits, promotions, or favors in exchange for sexual acts   (quid pro quo harassment).

- Threatening about consequences (like firing or demotion) for refusing sexual advances.

- Using one's authority to manipulate someone into unwanted interactions.


Whether an action comes under the scope of sexual harassment or not is not determined by its intent alone but by its impact also. Even if someone does not intend to harass, if their behavior makes another person feel uncomfortable,  or threatened, it can still be considered harassment.
