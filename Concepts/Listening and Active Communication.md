## 1. Active Listening

Question 1

What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? (Minimum 6 points)

- Avoid getting distracted by your own thoughts. Instead focus on the speaker and the topic.
- Try not to interrupt the other person. Let them finish and then respond.
- Use door openers. These are phrases that show that you are interested like "tell me more" ,"that sounds interesting" etc.
- Show that you are listening with body language.
- If appropriate take notes during important conversations.
- Paraphrase the conversation to make sure you are on the same page.

Question 3

What are the obstacles in your listening process?

The main obstacle in my listening process is that I often lose focus and think about some random things that come to my mind. Even if I regain my focus and listen later, I may not understand as I might have missed some parts. This absent-mindeddness sometimes makes me ask the speaker to repeat what they said.

Question 4

What can you do to improve your listening?

To improve my listening, I can try to stay fully present and avoid distractions. I will make a conscious effort to focus on the speaker and not let my mind wander. Taking notes and maintaining eye contact can also help.


Question 5

When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?

I tend to switch to a passive communication style in formal situations, such as at the workplace. Examples include : 
 - When I'm unsure about a topic or when I feel that my input might not be valued.
 - When I want to keep the peace or avoid arguments.
 - When speaking to someone in a higher position or when I feel nervous or under pressure.


Question 6

When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

I tend to switch to an aggressive communication style when I feel extremely frustrated or when I feel I'm not being heard or understood. It can also happen when I'm under a lot of stress or pressure, and I struggle to stay calm.
This usually happens when someone close to me, say family, doesnot understand me as I expect them to.

Question 7

When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

I tend to switch to a passive-aggressive communication style when I feel upset but don't feel comfortable expressing it directly. At times, I might use sarcasm or stay silent instead of talking about what’s bothering me. It can also happen when I feel powerless in a situation and don’t know how to express my emotions in a healthy way.


Question 8

How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyse the videos, then think what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life? (Watch the videos first before answering this question.)

To make communication assertive, I can take the following steps:
- Learn to recognize and name my feelings.
- Learn to recognize and name what I need. Try to understand why I need something i.e realise the need behind a need.
- Start with low-stake situations. eg: Talk assertively to a best friend. This can make me more confident in formal situations too.
