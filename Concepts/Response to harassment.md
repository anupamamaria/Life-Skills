## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I face or witness sexual harassment, I would take the following steps:

- Speak Up

If I face any such behaviour, I would ask the person to stop that and let the person know that I'm not comfortable with such behaviour.

If I witness such an incident, I would advise the victim to talk to the offender and ask the person to stop it.

If necessary, I would seek help from a trusted colleague or management.

-  Document the Incident

I would write down what happened, including dates, times, locations, people involved, and any witnesses.

If possible, I would collect any supporting evidence (e.g., messages, emails, or screenshots).

-  Report the Incident

If the harasser doesnot stop the behaviour even after informing, I would report the harassment to the designated complaints committee of my company.

-  Support the Victim (If I'm a Witness)

I would listen to the victim, reassure them, and let them know they are not alone.

If they want to report the harassment, I would offer to be a witness or help them with the due process.
