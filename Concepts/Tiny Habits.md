## Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg
Question 1

In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea from this video was that we don't need to have an extraordinary willpower to build a habit, we just need to place it at the rigth spot and it will grow naturally. I could instantly agree with this though this was a completely new idea. The only effort, according to the speaker, is that we need to plan suitably to choose the right spot. Here, right spot means a habit which we already have. That habit will be the anchor to which we can attach the new habit we need to build. For instance, flossing a tooth after brushing.

Question 2

How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

In the formula, B = MAP, M stands for Motivation, A for Ability and P for Prompt. To build a new behaviour, we can shrink the size of the habit we need to build as it is easy to overcome the activity level needed for a tiny task as its motivation requirement is low. Once you find the tiniest version of a habit which you are able to do in less than say 30 seconds, you need to set a prompt which is like linking it to an already existing habit. This is more effective than an external (eg: an alarm) or internal prompt (eg: a feeling or urge), both of which can be easily dismissed. Thus finding a tiny task which need less motivation and supporting it with a prompt will help you grow that habit and transform it to a behaviour in the long run.


Question 3

Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?

It's important to celebrate after each successful completion of a task however small it seems. Because, one is more likely to repeat a task which gives a sense of accomplishment as this builds the motivation and confidence to do it more often. This is called the success momentum and it is not the size of the success but the frequency of success which creates it. When we are resisting to celebrate small wins, we are choosing not to be as good as we could be at building habits.

Question 4

In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea for me was that rather than relying on our willpower or motivation to build habits, we can build a good environment around us which can prompt us to positive behaviours sometimes even unknowingly. The speaker says the example of how he keeps his social media apps in a folder in his phone away from his home screen so that he doesnot mindlessly take them. Also, the example of keeping apples at the counter so that he can see them often and eat them, rather then keeping them in the fridge which he forgets almost everytime.
Thus the trick is to keep the bad habits away from us and keep the good habits in our proximity.

Question 5

What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The books says that rather than focussing on outomes or results, one should focus on her identity. For instance, my need to go to gym should not come from my need to reduce my belly fat but from my identity as a healthy person. So, since I'm a healthy person, I have to follow a healthy lifestyle, eat a balanced diet and do regular exercise. Over time, this will give me the results as well.

Question 6

Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

To make a habit easier to do:
-  we have to make the cues obvious. Design our environment accordingly eg: Keep the new tablets you have to take near the tablets you already take daily.
- we have to make the habits easy by reducing the friction. Find a tiny and easy version of the habit and stick to it.
- We have to make the habit attractive eg: During workout, I will listen to my favourite music.
- We have to make it satisfying. This means that we have to give small rewards when tasks are done. eg: After going for a morning walk you can enjoy your favorite smoothie afterward.

Question 7

Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

The habits look harder when :
- The cues are invisible. eg: when the tablet you need to take is not kept in your room.
- Habits are difficult. eg: you keep phone near your study table which makes it hard to avoid it.
- Habits are unattractive. eg: you want to go to gym regularly.
- The rewards are unsatisfying. eg: You eat salad for a week but donâ€™t see weight loss.

##  Reflection

Question 8

Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

I would like to cultivate the habit of reading newspaper daily.
- Make the cue obvious:

    I will place the newspaper on my breakfast table.
- Make the habit easy:

    I will start with just two articles per day.
- Make the habit attractive:

    I will start with a section I actually enjoy eg: Culture
- Make the response satisfying:

    After a week of consistently reading newspaper, I will have my favourite home-made coffee.



Question 9

Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

I would like to eliminate my social media usage.

- Make the cue invisible:

    I can turn off notifications and remove the apps from my homescreen.
- Make the habit difficult:

    I can log out after every use.
- Make the habit unattractive:

    I can read about how social media impacts mental health
- Make the reward unsatisfying:

    Write down how I feel after wasting time on it.
